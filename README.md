# React Calculator

Built based on [this tutorial](https://testdriven.io/blog/tdd-with-react-jest-and-enzyme-part-one/) using React, Typescript, Jest, and Enzyme.

### Key Takeaways

* Employed Test-Driven Development, along with Enzyme and Jest, to structure our application and write our tests
* Used CSS Variables to allow for variable reuse and reassignment for responsive design
* Written a reusable React component that we were able to render with individual functions and in multiple styles
* Used Typescript in React for type-checking throughout the application

### Next Steps
* Fix "." button functionality
  * Write a test first, debug, and then write the code to pass the test

* Identify difference in functionality of selecting a key following an operation
  * Compare this calculator with another calculator, isolate the differences in the experience, write some tests for the new outcomes, and update the calculator functionality to get the tests green

* Change up and experiment with the CSS

* Add a loading transition
* Add an event listener for keyboard events to the application for a better user experience.
